**Technical Challenge**

We understand your time is precious, but as discussed, we ask each applicant to take on our small challenges.

There is no right or wrong approach and we're certainly not expecting war and peace 😊.

**Challenge #1**

A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources on a cloud environment (Azure/AWS/GCP). Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

**Challenge #2**

We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within AWS or Azure or GCP and provide a json formatted output.\
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

**Bonus Points**

The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

Hints

-         Aws Documentation (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/>)

-         Azure Documentation (<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured>)

-         Google Documentation (<https://cloud.google.com/docs>)

**Challenge #3**

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.

The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Example Inputs

object = {"a":{"b":{"c":"d"}}}

key = a/b/c

object = {"x":{"y":{"z":"a"}}}

key = x/y/z

value = a

Hints:

*We would like to see some tests.*

[*A quick read to help you along the way*](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/Kernel.html#get_in/2)* - We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.*
